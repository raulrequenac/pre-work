          <h2>The Road to Enlightenment</h2>
          <p>
            Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of
            browser-specific tags, incompatible DOMs, broken CSS support, and
            abandoned browsers.
          </p>
          <p>
            We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightement has been
            achieved thanks to the tireless efforts of folk like W3C, WaSP, and
            the major browser creators.

          <h2>So What is This About?</h2>
          <p>
            There is a continuing need to show the power of CSS. The CSS Zen
            Garden aims to excite, inspire, and encourage participation. To
            begin, view some of the existing designs in the list. Clicking on
            any one will load the style sheet into this very page. The HTML
            remains the same, the only thing that has changed is the external
            CSS file. Yes, really.
          </p>
          <p>
            CSS allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext
            document. The only way this can be illustrated in a way that gets
            people excited is by demonstrating what it can truly be, once the
            reins are placed in the hands of those able to create beauty from
            structure. Designers and coders alike have contributed to the beauty
            of the web; we can always push it further.

          <h2>Participation</h2>
          <p>
            Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying
            this page, so strong CSS skills are necesary too, but the example
            files are well enought that even CSS novices can use them as
            starting points. Please see the
            <a href="#">CSS Resource Guide</a> for advanced tutorials and tips
            on working with CSS.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may modify the style sheet in a way you wish, but not the HTML.
            This may seem daunting at first if you've never worked this way
            before, but follow the listed links to learn more, and use the
            sample files as a guide.
          </p>
          <p>
            Download the sample <a href="#">HTML</a> and <a href="#">CSS</a> to
            work on a copy locally. Once you have completed our masterpiece (and
            please, don't submit half-finished work) upload your CSS file to a
            web server under your control. <a href="#">Send us a link</a> to an
            archive of that file and all the associated assets, and if we choose
            to use it we will download it and place it in our server.

            serves as equal parts inspiration for those working on the web
            today, learning tool for who will be tomorrow, and gallery of future
            techniques we can all look forward to.
